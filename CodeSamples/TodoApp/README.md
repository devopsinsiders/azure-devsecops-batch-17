## 1. Prerequisites

- A computer with internet access
- Basic knowledge of using a terminal/command prompt

---

## 2. AWS Account Setup

1. Go to [https://aws.amazon.com/free/](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) and sign up for a free AWS account.
2. Complete the registration and verify your email and phone number.
3. Log in to the [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/).

---

## 3. Install Required Tools

Install the following tools on your computer:

### a. [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Download and install Git for your operating system.

### b. [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Download and install Python 3.x (choose "Add Python to PATH" during installation).

### c. [Node.js & npm](https://nodejs.org/)
- Download and install Node.js (npm comes bundled).

### d. [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads)
- Download and install Terraform.

### e. [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- Download and install the AWS Command Line Interface.

## 4. Configure AWS Credentials

1. Open a terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows).
2. Run:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
3. Enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, region (e.g., `us-east-1`), and output format (`json`).

---

## 5. Deploy Infrastructure with Terraform

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `InfraAutomation/todoapp_infra` directory:
   ```
   cd path\to\TodoApp\InfraAutomation\todoapp_infra
   ```
2. Initialize Terraform:
   ```
   terraform init
   ```
3. Review the plan:
   ```
   terraform plan
   ```
4. Apply the infrastructure (type `yes` when prompted):
   ```
   terraform apply
   ```
   - This will create AWS resources (EC2, RDS, S3, VPC, IAM roles) as defined in the Terraform files.
   - Wait for the process to complete. Note the outputs (public IPs, endpoints) shown at the end.

---

## 6. Deploy the Backend (Python)

1. Connect to the EC2 instance created by Terraform:
   - Find the public IP address from the Terraform output.
   - Use SSH to connect (replace `<ec2-user>` and `<public-ip>`):
     ```
     ssh ec2-user@<public-ip>
     ```
   - On Windows, you can use [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/) or Git Bash.

2. Once connected, install Python dependencies:
   ```
   sudo yum update -y
   sudo yum install python3 -y
   sudo pip3 install -r /home/ec2-user/PyTodoBackendMonolith/requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up environment variables for database connection (use RDS info from Terraform output):
   ```
   export DB_HOST=<rds-endpoint>
   export DB_USER=<db-username>
   export DB_PASS=<db-password>
   export DB_NAME=<db-name>
   ```

4. Start the backend server:
   ```
   python3 /home/ec2-user/PyTodoBackendMonolith/app.py
   ```

---

## 7. Deploy the Frontend (React)

1. On your local machine, open a new terminal.
2. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```
   cd path\to\TodoApp\FrontendTodo\ReactTodoUIMonolith
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Update the API endpoint in the frontend code (if needed) to point to your EC2 instanceâ€™s public IP.
   - Edit `src/TodoApp.js` or relevant file and set the backend API URL.

5. Start the React app:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   - The app will open in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

---

## 8. Access the Application

- Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to use the TodoApp.
- The frontend will communicate with the backend running on your EC2 instance.

---

## 9. Cleanup Resources

To avoid AWS charges, destroy all resources when done:

1. In the terminal, go to the Terraform directory:
   ```
   cd path\to\TodoApp\InfraAutomation\todoapp_infra
   ```
2. Run:
   ```
   terraform destroy
   ```
   - Type `yes` when prompted.

---

## 10. Troubleshooting

- **Permission errors:** Ensure your AWS user has sufficient permissions.
- **Connection issues:** Check security group rules in AWS to allow inbound traffic (ports 22 for SSH, 5000 for backend, 3000 for frontend if needed).
- **Dependency errors:** Ensure all required tools are installed and up to date.
