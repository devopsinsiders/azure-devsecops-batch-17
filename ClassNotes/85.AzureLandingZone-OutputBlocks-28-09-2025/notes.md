# üèóÔ∏è **Comprehensive Notes on Azure Landing Zone & Terraform**

---

## üåê **1. Azure Landing Zone Overview**

An **Azure Landing Zone** is a **predefined architecture** that provides a foundation for deploying workloads securely and efficiently in Azure.
It ensures proper **governance, networking, identity, and security** before onboarding any application.

---

### **1.1 Normal Landing Zone Flow**

| Step                     | Description                                                                            |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Onboarding Solution**  | Includes creation of subscriptions, users, groups, and access management through RBAC. |
| **Offboarding Solution** | Handles deletion of subscriptions, users, and groups along with access revocation.     |

---

### **1.2 Core Components**

1. **Subscriptions:**

   * Logical boundaries for workloads.
   * Example: Subscription1 for Application 1, Subscription2 for Application 2.

2. **VNet Architecture:**

   * Each application gets a dedicated VNet.
   * Example:

     * Application 1 ‚Üí VNet with Subnet1 & Subnet2
     * Application 2 ‚Üí VNet with Subnet1 & Subnet2

3. **Network Connectivity:**

   * Hub-and-spoke model ensures secure communication.
   * On-prem connectivity achieved using **VPN or ExpressRoute**.

---

### **1.3 Governance and Management**

* **CAF (Cloud Adoption Framework):** Microsoft‚Äôs best-practice guide for structured migration and governance.
* **Governance & Guardrails:**

  * Policies, RBAC, naming standards, tagging conventions.
* **IAM (Identity & Access Management):** Ensures proper access control.
* **Monitoring & Logging:** Through **Log Analytics**, **Azure Monitor**, and **Application Insights**.

---

### **1.4 IDP Portal ‚Äì Internal Developer Portal**

* Provides a **centralized interface** for onboarding new applications.
* Developers can fill application details such as:

  * Application Name
  * Owner Application
  * Submit button triggers automation for onboarding into the landing zone.

---

## üöÄ **2. Migration Strategy (Phased Approach)**

Azure migrations are done in **phases**, using Agile methodology with automation and KPIs (Key Performance Indicators).

---

### **Phase 0 ‚Äì Planning (42 Days, 2 Sprints)**

* Stakeholder Identification
* Skill Gap Analysis & Training Plan
* Definition of project scope and success metrics

---

### **Phase 1 ‚Äì Discovery and Assessment**

* Inventory current environment
* Capture OS details, existing workloads, and dependencies
* Identify applications suitable for cloud migration

---

### **Phase 2 ‚Äì Target Architecture (HLD & LLD)**

* **High-Level Design (HLD):**

  * Tenant onboarding, Hub-Spoke design, VPN setup, Azure AD, governance, security, monitoring, tagging, DR planning.
* **Low-Level Design (LLD):**

  * Detailed configuration ‚Äî exact naming, sizes, and resource definitions.

---

### **Phase 3 ‚Äì Landing Zone Implementation**

* Deploy platform services using **Infrastructure as Code (IAC)**.
* Create **Management Group and Subscription Hierarchy**.
* Establish **Hub Network Connectivity** (VPN/ExpressRoute).
* Configure **Log Analytics**, **Security Baselines**, and **Governance Policies**.

---

### **Phase 4 ‚Äì Azure Migrate Setup & Testing Plan**

* Configure **Azure Migrate** and **Azure Site Recovery**.
* Define pre-migration validation and rollback procedures.

---

### **Phase 5 ‚Äì Migration Execution**

* Perform the migration using **Azure Migrate** and **ASR**.
* Validate using **Pre-Migration** and **Post-Migration Checklists**.

---

### **Phase 6 ‚Äì Production Cutover & Sign-off**

* Switch production workloads to Azure.
* Validate business continuity and performance.
* Obtain final approval from stakeholders.

---

### **Phase 7 ‚Äì Decommission, Cleanup & Closure**

* Remove old resources and obsolete data.
* Ensure clean-up of unused accounts and network configurations.

---

### **Phase 8 ‚Äì Support Transition & Incident Management**

* Handover to operations team.
* Establish incident management and escalation procedures.

---

## üß† **3. Homework (Suggested Topics)**

* Database Migration
* AD Migration
* DR (Disaster Recovery) & High Availability Setup
* Governance Policy Implementation
* Security & Compliance Configuration
* Monitoring and Logging Implementation

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **4. Terraform Overview**

Terraform is an **open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** tool that automates the creation and management of infrastructure across multiple clouds.

---

### **4.1 Key Features**

* Open source & multi-cloud support
* Manages infrastructure **state** efficiently
* Ensures **repeatable and predictable** deployments

---

### **4.2 Setup & Installation**

* Install Terraform
* Setup **VS Code** and **Azure CLI**
