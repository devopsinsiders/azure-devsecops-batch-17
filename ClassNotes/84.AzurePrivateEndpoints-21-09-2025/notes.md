# üåê **Topic: Azure Private Endpoint**

### **1. What is a Private Endpoint?**

* A **Private Endpoint** in Azure is a **network interface (NIC)** that connects you privately and securely to Azure services like:

  * Storage Accounts
  * SQL Databases
  * Synapse Analytics, etc.
* It assigns a **private IP address** from your **Virtual Network (VNet)** to the Azure resource.
* This ensures that **traffic flows entirely within the Azure backbone network**, avoiding exposure to the public internet.

---

### **2. Benefits of Private Endpoint**

‚úÖ **True private access** ‚Äî Services are accessible via **private IP** only.
‚úÖ **No public exposure** ‚Äî Public access can be **disabled** in the resource configuration.
‚úÖ **Enhanced security** ‚Äî No need to allow public endpoints or open firewall rules for the internet.
‚úÖ **Complete traffic isolation** ‚Äî Traffic between VM and storage remains **within your VNet**.

### **3. Example Architecture (from diagram)**

* **Virtual Network (VNet1)**

  * Contains **Subnet1** and **Subnet2**.
* **VM (dhondhu-vm)**

  * Has NIC with private IP `10.10.1.3`
* **Azure Storage Account (dhondhustorage)**

  * Public FQDN: `https://dhondhustorage.blob.core.windows.net`
  * **A Record:** `20.150.114.97` (public)
  * **CNAME:** `dhondhustorage.privatelink.blob.core.windows.net`
  * Private endpoint IP: `10.1.2.14`
* When Private Endpoint is configured, the VM accesses storage **using the private IP (10.1.2.14)** instead of the public one.

---

### **4. DNS Configuration and Resolution**

#### DNS Records involved:

* **A Record:** Maps a domain name directly to an IP address.
  Example:

  ```
  jhandu.shop ‚Üí 45.23.12.43
  ```
* **CNAME Record:** Maps a domain to another domain name.
  Example:

  ```
  dhondhustorage.blob.core.windows.net ‚Üí dhondhustorage.privatelink.blob.core.windows.net
  ```
* When Private Endpoint is set up, DNS automatically updates the blob storage endpoint to resolve **privately inside the VNet**.

---

### **5. Prerequisites**

Before configuring a Private Endpoint:

1. **Storage Account** with **Public Access Disabled**
2. **Dedicated Virtual Network (VNet)** and **Subnet**
3. **Private DNS Zone** linked with the VNet

   * Example: `privatelink.blob.core.windows.net`
4. **VM** inside the same VNet to verify connectivity.

---

### **6. How Traffic Flows**

1. VM tries to access `dhondhustorage.blob.core.windows.net`
2. DNS resolves it to the **private IP (10.1.2.14)** via Private DNS Zone
3. Network traffic stays within the VNet
4. Storage access occurs **privately and securely**

---

### **7. Key Concept: Private Endpoint = NIC**

Each Private Endpoint creates a **network interface card (NIC)** in your VNet that represents the private connection to the Azure resource.

---

### **8. Example Domain Mapping**

* **Domain purchase:** `jhandu.shop`
* If you want to map it to an IP:
  ‚Üí Use **A Record**
* If you want to map it to another domain:
  ‚Üí Use **CNAME Record**

Example:

```
A Record ‚Üí jhandu.shop ‚Üí 45.23.12.43
CNAME ‚Üí shop.jhandu.com ‚Üí jhandu.shop
```

---

### **9. Supported Private Endpoint Services**

* Azure **Storage Account**
* **Azure SQL Database**
* **Azure Synapse Analytics**
* (and many other PaaS services)

---

### **10. Notes from the Diagram**

* Public access for storage: **Disabled**
* Private endpoint gives **True Private Access**
* Example resource names:

  * `dhondhustorage.blob.core.windows.net` ‚Üí public
  * `dhondhustorage.privatelink.blob.core.windows.net` ‚Üí private
* VM `dhondhu-vm` connects privately using the assigned NIC and private IP.

  * **Azure Monitor**
  * **Log Analytics Workspace**
  * **Terraform Code for Azure Load Balancer**
